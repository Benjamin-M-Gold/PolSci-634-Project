# PolSci-634-Project

This is my Final Project for Political Science 634

The Code For ERGM.R file contains the code for my empirical model
It accesses data from the 200electiondata.csv file, which contains all the legislators from the 115th congress as well as their state, party, endorsement in the 2008 Presidential Primaries and DW-NOMINATE ideology score.
